## <a name='overview'>ü¶ä Rules</a>

Hi, here are some rules to carry out this story oav;

- You **MUST** create a git repository named `cx-eloquent`
- You **MUST** create a file called `.author` with your firstname and lastname followed by a newline.
- You **MUST** create a file for each exercises **e01.js**, **e02.js**, etc

```sh
~/eloquent ‚ùØ‚ùØ‚ùØ cat -e .author
Majdi Toumi$
```

> Of course, you can talk about the subject with other developers, peer-learning is
> the key to be a better developer. Don't hesitate to ask questions or help people on slack.

> Don't forget, there is no useless question :-)

- No pression it's only exercises for learning
- YOU **MUST** define all functions signature by yourself :)

## <a name='steps'>üê® Steps</a>

### 01. Write a JavaScript function that reverse a number.

Example `x = 32243;`<br />
Expected Output : `34223`

### 02. Write a JavaScript function that checks whether a passed string is palindrome or not?

> A palindrome is word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.

### 03. Write a JavaScript function that generates all combinations of a string.

Example string : `'dog'`<br />
Expected Output : `d,do,dog,o,og,g`

### 04. Write a JavaScript function that returns a passed string with letters in alphabetical order

Example string : `'webmaster'`<br />
Expected Output : `'abeemrstw'`

> Assume punctuation and numbers symbols are not included in the passed string.

### 05. Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and converts the first letter of each word of the string in upper case

Example string : `'the quick brown fox'`
Expected Output : `'The Quick Brown Fox '`

### 06. Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and find the longest word within the string

Example string : `'Web Development Tutorial'`<br />
Expected Output : `'Development'`

### 07. Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and counts the number of vowels within the string

Example string : `'The quick brown fox'`<br />
Expected Output : `5`

### 08. Write a JavaScript function that accepts a number as a parameter and check the number is prime or not

> A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

### 09. Write a JavaScript function which accepts an argument and returns the type

> There are six possible values that typeof returns: object, boolean, function, number, string, and undefined.

### 010. Write a JavaScript function which returns the n rows by n columns identity matri

### 011. Write a JavaScript function which will take an array of numbers stored and find the second lowest and second greatest numbers, respectively

Sample array : `[1,2,3,4,5]`<br />
Expected Output : `2,4`

### 012. Write a JavaScript function which says whether a number is perfect

> According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself).

Example : The first perfect number is `6`, because `1`, `2`, and `3` are its proper positive divisors, and `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.<br />
Equivalently, the number `6` is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: `( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6`.<br />
The next perfect number is `28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14`.<br />

This is followed by the perfect numbers `496` and `8128`.

### 013. Write a JavaScript function to compute the factors of a positive integer

### 014. Write a JavaScript function to convert an amount to coins

Sample function : `amountTocoins(46, [25, 10, 5, 2, 1])`<br />
Here `46` is the amount. and `25, 10, 5, 2, 1` are coins.<br />
Output : `25, 10, 10, 1`.

### 015. Write a JavaScript function to compute the value of b^n where n is the exponent and b is the bases. Accept b and n from the user and display the result

### 016. Write a JavaScript function to extract unique characters from a string

Example string : `"thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog"`<br />
Expected Output : `"thequickbrownfxjmpsvlazydg"`.

### 017. Write a JavaScript function to  get the number of occurrences of each letter in specified string

### 018. Write a JavaScript function that accepts two arguments, a string and a letter and the function will count the number of occurrences of the specified letter within the string

Sample arguments : `'w3resource.com', 'o'`<br />
Expected output : `2`

### 019. Write a JavaScript function to find the first not repeated character

Sample arguments : `'abacddbec'`<br />
Expected output : `'e'`

### 020. Write a JavaScript function that accept a list of country names as input and returns the longest country name as output

Sample function : `Longest_Country_Name(["Australia", "Germany", "United States of America"])`<br />
Expected output : `"United States of America"`
